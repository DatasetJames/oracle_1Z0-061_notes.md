# Introduction

I have compiled these notes whilst revising for the Oracle 1Z0-061 Exam - Oracle Database 12c: SQL Fundamentals. They should also be relevant to the 1Z0-051 - Oracle Database 11g: SQL Fundamentals exam.

I have aimed to include include in these notes common "gotchas" and easy to forget functionality rather than documenting everything required for the exam. This can then be used as a quick refresher before walking into the exam.

The content is broken up into sections with each heading mapping to the relevant [Oracle 1Z0-061 exam topics](https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-061).
